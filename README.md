Prices on e-commerce platforms can fluctuate frequently 
due to sales, promotions, and stock levels. Manually checking 
prices across multiple websites is labour-intensive and inefficient. To overcome this, 
we have come up with a solution, that is “PRICE WATCH”. The Price Watch 
project is designed by leveraging web scraping techniques such as Beautiful Soup 
and Selenium, and also used the MERN stack for developing the website for users 
to interact, to monitor the prices of selected products across e-commerce platforms. 
The core objective is to provide users with real-time updates and alerts on price 
fluctuations, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.
